# Java Programming
This is the University of Helsinkiâ€™s massive open online course (MOOC) on Java Programming.

Find more about this course [here][mooc_material].

The course contains a bunch of problem sets to help you be more familiar with Java.
I created this repository to save all my solutions for those problems. Feel free to try its out, compare its to yours and give me your feedback if needed.
