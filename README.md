# Java Programming
This is the University of Helsinkiâ€™s massive open online course (MOOC) on Java Programming.

Find more about this course [here][mooc_material].

The course contains a bunch of problem sets to help you be more familiar with Java.
I created this repository to save all my solutions for those problems. Feel free to try its out, compare its to yours and give me your feedback if needed.

The course is split up into two individual courses: Java Programming I and Java Programming II.

## Java Programming I
### Part 1
- [Printing][ps_1]
- [Reading Input][ps_2]
- [Variables][ps_3]
- [Calculating with numbers][ps_4]
- [Conditional statements and conditional operation][ps_5]

### Part 2
- [Recurring Problems and Patterns to Solve them][ps_6]
- [Repeating Functionality][ps_7]
- [More Loops][ps_8]
- [Methods and Dividing the Program into Smaller Parts][ps_9]

### Part 3
- [Lists][ps_10]
- [Arrays][ps_11]
- [Using Strings][ps_12]

### Part 4
- [Introduction to Object Oriented Programming][ps_13]
- [Objects in a List][ps_14]
- [Files and Reading Data][ps_15]

### Part 5
- [Learning Object Oriented Programming][ps_16]
- [Removing Repetitive Code][ps_17] (overloading methods and constructors)
- [Objects and References][ps_18]

### Part 6
- [Objects on a List and a List as Part of an Object][ps_19]
- [Separating the User Interface from Program Logic][ps_20]
- [Introduction to Testing][ps_21]
