# Java Programming
This is the University of Helsinkiâ€™s massive open online course (MOOC) on Java Programming.

Find more about this course [here][mooc_material].

The course contains a bunch of problem sets to help you be more familiar with Java.
I created this repository to save all my solutions for those problems. Feel free to try its out, compare its to yours and give me your feedback if needed.

The course is split up into two individual courses: Java Programming I and Java Programming II.
